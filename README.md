# 🌾 Smart Farming with AI and IoT – Virtual Irrigation System

This project simulates a smart farming system that uses AI to decide whether irrigation is needed, based on virtual sensor data (Temperature, Humidity, Soil Moisture, and Rainfall). It's deployed using **Streamlit Cloud** and trained with a **Random Forest Classifier**.

## 🚀 Features
- Virtual sensor sliders for real-time control
- AI model predicts irrigation needs
- Interactive UI built with Streamlit
- Deployable on Streamlit Cloud
- Simulated data for testing ML pipeline
